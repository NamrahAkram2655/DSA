<strong>Task 1:</strong> Implement two functions to find the intersection of two arrays. The first function achieves a time complexity of 𝜪(𝒏𝟐) without creating new arrays, while the second function attains a time complexity of 𝑶(𝒏𝒍𝒈𝒏) under the same constraint.

<strong>Task 2:</strong> Create a function to find the kth smallest element in an array of n elements, with a time complexity that depends on the sorting algorithm used, typically 𝑶(𝒏log𝒏).

<strong>Task 3:</strong> Develop a program that takes a filename and a word, then displays the occurrences of that word in each line of the text file, adhering to a specific format.<br>
